AI-Based Video Subtitle Generator – Architecture & Implementation
This app will allow users to upload videos, and AI will generate subtitles automatically. It uses OpenAI’s Whisper for transcription and FFmpeg for handling video files.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend (React & Android)
Upload video files (MP4, MOV, etc.).
Show progress while processing.
Display and allow manual editing of subtitles.
Download the final video with embedded subtitles.
Backend (Express + Whisper AI + FFmpeg)
Receive video uploads via Express API.
Extract audio from video using FFmpeg.
Transcribe audio using Whisper AI.
Sync subtitles using timestamps.
Generate subtitle files (SRT, VTT, hardcoded).
Store & serve processed videos.
CI/CD (Automated Deployments)
Backend: Deploy with Docker & Kubernetes (AWS Lambda for scaling).
Frontend: Vercel (for React) & Firebase App Distribution (for Android).
Model Updates: Auto-deploy Whisper AI updates with GitHub Actions.

2️⃣ Express Backend Saves Video (AWS S3 / Firebase Storage)
3️⃣ FFmpeg Extracts Audio (MP3/WAV)
4️⃣ Whisper AI Generates Transcription
5️⃣ Sync Subtitles with Timestamps
6️⃣ Subtitles Provided in SRT/VTT or Burned into Video
7️⃣ User Downloads Final Video
